# First Day
First Day or Few Days of Introduction Ideas

Ensure all students are in the correct room for the course on their timetable.
- Time Table Changes will happen later but must in the course of your timetable

**Table of Contents**
- Setting up Tables, Stools, & Workstations: Our first problem of the day
  - Also see below, <a href="">Problem-solving of a beginning workstation</a>
- Turning on the Computer with Multiple Monitors: <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/First%20Day#introduction-to-tools-used-in-mercers-kitchen-for-language-agnostic-computer-science-instruction">Introduction to Online Tools</a>
- Review BYOD Repository and Installation Instructions for all software this year (Answers Questions for "Who Brings their Own Computers")
  - Note: if you want Cyber Security, you have your own computer, and you are *comfortable bringing it to school*, you should :)
- Reviewing Course Outline (See Course GitHub / Admin for Specific Course Outline, Introduction to Navigating GitHub)
  - Note: Ensure time-tables are correct
- Overview of major projects (similar to goal setting, start with "what do you want to accomplish in this course")
  - Main Project: Beginning a Portfolio in GitHub for Edmonton Regional Science Fair , CS Pitches, or QE Open House and other visitors

Creating a Culture of Creating and Problem Solving, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/First%20Day#creating-a-culture-of-creating-and-problem-solving">More Information</a>
- If you knew how to create it, it would not be a problem ... and you have multiple guides
- Computer and Online Materials
- Teacher: answering questions, presenting some materials, scheduling time through time consuming projects

Final Exit Slip: "What do you want to accomplish this semester?"
- Brainstorming, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/First%20Day#first-day-algorithms-or-design-of-main-project">See Notes Below</a>
- Tell Mr. Mercer so I can see if it can be worked into the course
- Ensure this is in your Project Portfolio on GitHub

## Problem-solving of a beginning workstation

Setting up a workstation: Laptop, Monitor, OS Settings & Configuration, Mouse, & Keyboard
- Cooperating with others to set up seating plan
  - Sit close to others who will help you learn (and balance your distractions)
  - Movement problem of figuring out work flow in the classroom: Issue of tripping hazards
- Benefit: no student ever has equipment that does not work without knowing what to fix
- Mention issue of sticky hands on laptop keyboards and trackpads vs. spring-action keyboards and USB-mice
- See YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/Bw1hj3s-8S0
- Note: Private Google Drive Folder for Images and Original PowerPoint: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L0ykkGBHxz-aRU1aw_sHHHaLfC8KZOgQ

## Introduction to Online Tools used in Mercer's Kitchen for Language Agnostic Computer Science Instruction
- GMail through Schoolzone (school-based email addresses), setting and forwarding mail
- Password Manager (Last Pass, KeePass), introduction to cyber security
- General EMail Security: pwned: see https://haveibeenpwned.com/
- Google Classroom for Daily Learning Objectives, links and daily reminders
- GitHub: Following Mr. Mercer through Mercer's Kitchen, Personal Account, Introduction to Submitting Assignments to GitHub Classroom (Submit Hello Repository on the First Day)
  - "Introduction to Where do Files Live"
  - GitHub Desktop (Opened First or, from GitHub, Open in GitHub Desktop)
- Workona, Chrome Extension (use Chrome Store & Workona Website, only if you do not have a Workona Account Yet)
  - Create Account on website first, using Schoolzone EMail
  - Add Chrome Extension
  - Save Passwords to Manager
  - Note: Chrome Update will eventually group TABS for us
- Semester School Calendar, using Google Calendar: events and general flow (Remember to turn off other calendars being shown)

Note: Instruction Videos are in Construction

## Creating a Culture of Creating and Problem Solving
Creating a Community, Thoughts from a Video ... **UNESCO Style**
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=tyaEQEmt5ls
- "Video is about what we can change and what we cannot change." We need to know the difference.
- Summary of DNA Journey
   - DNA cannot be changed
   - Beliefs, who I like, who I do not like, can all change
   - "Who is your cousin?"
   - "It will be in a community ideas are nurtured and people supported"

Teaching answers or teaching with questions, Mr. Mercer prefers teaching with questions and problem-based learning
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1K2jdjLhbo
- An example algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il5oEPNASmg
- Is this true?
- A video of the full algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjnDdrujSU
- What are the magic tricks or algorithms of the now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hANXIPxN1ME
   - (Robotic Domino's Ford Autonomous Pizza Delivery Vehicle)

How do we get there from High School?
- Skills Alberta Canada: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5If09ESV65k">2019 Promotional Video</a>
- Edmonton Regional Science Fair, <a href="https://secure.youthscience.ca/sfiab/edmonton3/">Website</a>
- Iverson Exam, <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/explore/iverson-exam">Website</a>
- HIP: High School Internship Program, <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/explore/hs-internships">Website</a>
- CS Pitches
- Mentoring other students through our coding and building, sometimes through sitting with them as they think

What do we need to consider to get there? (Video from 2011 & 2012)
- What did people imagine back them?
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax5cNlutAys
- Algorithms are now about personal choice, delivering information ... what does this mean?
- One Person's opinion: https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?language=en#t-525329
  - Now we need to email each other the full search URL for the stuff we want them to read
- What does this mean for education? Remember, Eli Pariser is only asking you to be aware of the information you consume
- Algorithms might be the next way of thinking ... "knowing what we need to do is what we need"
- What are the ethics of algorithms?
- What will be your next steps in school? What will be your next things you learn? What choices and items will you learn so the grades and courses you earn and complete will empower you to the next best steps?

## First Day Algorithms or Design of Main Project
- Design this "thing": general question without a lot of guidance ... students provided 11x17 paper and encouragement to answer design issues
- Result: "Design is important", especially knowing about processing in design
  - Goals, purposes, materials, resources
  - Card board prototyping to understand shapes, sizes, hardware distances (wires, etc.)
  - 3D Printing Prototyping
  - Native Software Prototyping
- CAUTION: students become unbalanced as first emotional experience to design and solving algorithms without clear answers

Record Result on GitHub Repo Main Project
- Record Highlights on Exit Slip
