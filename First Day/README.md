# First Day
First Day or Few Days of Introduction Ideas

Ensure all students are in the correct room for the course on their timetable.
- Time Table Changes will happen later but must in the course of your timetable

**Table of Contents**
- Setting up Tables, Stools, & Workstations: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L0ykkGBHxz-aRU1aw_sHHHaLfC8KZOgQ">Mr. Mercer's PowerPoint</a>
  - Also see below, <a href="">Problem-solving of a beginning workstation</a>
- Turning on the Computer with Multiple Monitors: <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/First%20Day#introduction-to-tools-used-in-mercers-kitchen-for-language-agnostic-computer-science-instruction">Introduction to Online Tools</a>
- Reviewing Course Outline (See Course GitHub / Admin for Specific Course Outline, Introduction to Navigating GitHub)
  Note: Ensure time-tables are correct

## Problem-solving of a beginning workstation

Setting up a workstation: Laptop, Monitor, OS Settings & Configuration, Mouse, & Keyboard
- Cooperating with others to set up seating plan
  - Sit close to others who will help you learn (and balance your distractions)
  - Movement problem of figuring out work flow in the classroom: Issue of tripping hazards
- Benefit: no student ever has equipment that does not work without knowing what to fix
- Mention issue of sticky hands on laptop keyboards and trackpads vs. spring-action keyboards and USB-mice
- See YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/Bw1hj3s-8S0
- Note: Private Google Drive Folder for Images and Original PowerPoint: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L0ykkGBHxz-aRU1aw_sHHHaLfC8KZOgQ

## Introduction to Tools used in Mercer's Kitchen for Language Agnostic Computer Science Instruction
- GMail through Schoolzone (school-based email addresses), setting and forwarding mail
- Google Classroom for Daily Learning Objectives, links and daily reminders
- GitHub: Following Mr. Mercer through Mercer's Kitchen, Personal Account, Introduction to Submitting Assignments to GitHub Classroom (Submit Hello Repository on the First Day)
  - "Introduction to Where do Files Live"
- Workona, Chrome Extension
- Semester School Calendar, using Google Calendar: events and general flow (Remember to turn off other calendars being shown)

## General Tasks

2.

3. Review the BYOD repository - know the information that will help with the software we use in class
4. Setting up (examples videos in construction)
   - GMail & Password Manager (Last Pass, KeePass)
   - General Email Security, pwned: see https://haveibeenpwned.com/
   - Google Classroom
   - GitHub and GitHub Desktop
   - Workona, Chrome Extension: use Chrome Store & Workona Website
     - Create account on website
     - Add Extension First
5. Overview of major projects (similar to goal setting, start with "what do you want to accomplish in this course")
   - Beginning a Portfolio in GitHub
6. Reviewing the Semester Calendar for events and general flow
7. Exit Slip: "What do you want to accomplish this semester?"
   - "What do you want in a portfolio by the end of the course?"

## Additional Ideas to Consider
Creating a Community, Thoughts from a Video ... **UNESCO Style**
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=tyaEQEmt5ls
- "Video is about what we can change and what we cannot change." We need to know the difference.
- Summary of DNA Journey
   - DNA cannot be changed
   - Beliefs, who I like, who I do not like, can all change
   - "Who is your cousin?"
   - "It will be in a community ideas are nurtured and people supported"

Teaching answers or teaching with questions, Mr. Mercer prefers teaching with questions and problem-based learning
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1K2jdjLhbo
- An example algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il5oEPNASmg
- Is this true?
- A video of the full algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjnDdrujSU
- What are the magic tricks or algorithms of the now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hANXIPxN1ME
   - (Robotic Domino's Ford Autonomous Pizza Deliever Vehicle)

How do we get there from High School?
- Skills Alberta Canada: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5If09ESV65k
- Mentoring other students through our coding and building, sometimes through sitting with them as they think

What do we need to consider to get there? (Video from 2011 & 2012)
- What did people imagine back them?
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax5cNlutAys
- Algorithms are now about personal choice, delivering information ... what does this mean?
- One Person's opinion: https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?language=en#t-525329
- What does this mean for education? Remember, Eli Pariser is only asking you to be aware of the information you consume
- Algorithms might be the next way of thinking ... "knowing what we need to do what we need"
- What are the ethics of algorithms?
- What will be your next steps in school? What will be your next things you learn? What choices and items will you learn so the grades and courses you earn and complete will empower you to the next best steps?

First Day Algorithms or Design of Project
- Design this "thing": general question without a lot of guidance ... students provided 11x17 paper and encouragement to answer design inssue
- Result: "Design is important", especially knowing about processing in design
  - Goals, purposes, materials, resources
  - Card board prototyping to understand shapes, sizes, hardware distances (wires, etc.)
  - 3D Printing Prototyping
  - Native Software Prototyping
- CAUTION: students become unbalanced as first emotional experience to design and solving algorithms without clear answers
