# First Day
---
## Introduction to Tools used in Mercer's Kitchen for Language Agnostic Computer Science Instruction
- GMail through Schoolzone (school-based email addresses)
- Google Classroom
- GitHub
- Workona, Chrome Extension
- Semester Calendar: events and general flow

## General Tasks
1. Reviewing the course outline and syllabus
   - Ensuring Time-tables are correct
   - See Google Drive for Course Outlines: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O4QRD_nzB74mrtD9EsrFUwX7P6CqrR7I
2. Setting up a workstation: Laptop, Monitor, OS Settings & Configuration, Mouse, & Keyboard
   - Problem-solving of setting up an actual workstation
   - Cooperating with others to set up seating plan
   - Movement problem of figuring out work flow in the classroom
   - Issue of tripping hazards
   - Benefit: no student ever has equipment that does not work without knowing what to fix
   - See example images (In Construction)
     - Issue of Sticky hands on laptop keyboards and trackpads vs. spring-action keyboards and USB-mice
   - See YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/Bw1hj3s-8S0
   - Note: Private Google Drive Folder for Images and Original PowerPoint: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L0ykkGBHxz-aRU1aw_sHHHaLfC8KZOgQ
3. Review the BYOD repository - know the information that will help with the software we use in class
4. Setting up (examples videos in construction)
   - GMail & Password Manager (Last Pass, KeePass)
   - General Email Security, pwned: see https://haveibeenpwned.com/
   - Google Classroom
   - GitHub and GitHub Desktop
   - Workona, Chrome Extension: use Chrome Store & Workona Website
     - Create account on website
     - Add Extension First
5. Overview of major projects (similar to goal setting, start with "what do you want to accomplish in this course")
   - Beginning a Portfolio in GitHub
6. Reviewing the Semester Calendar for events and general flow
7. Exit Slip: "What do you want to accomplish this semester?"
   - "What do you want in a portfolio by the end of the course?"

## Additional Ideas to Consider
Creating a Community, Thoughts from a Video ... **UNESCO Style**
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=tyaEQEmt5ls
- "Video is about what we can change and what we cannot change." We need to know the difference.
- Summary of DNA Journey
   - DNA cannot be changed
   - Beliefs, who I like, who I do not like, can all change
   - "Who is your cousin?"
   - "It will be in a community ideas are nurtured and people supported"

Teaching answers or teaching with questions, Mr. Mercer prefers teaching with questions and problem-based learning
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1K2jdjLhbo
- An example algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il5oEPNASmg
- Is this true?
- A video of the full algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjnDdrujSU
- What are the magic tricks or algorithms of the now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hANXIPxN1ME

How do we get there from High School?
- Skills Alberta Canada: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5If09ESV65k
- Mentoring other students through our coding and building, sometimes through sitting with them as they think

What do we need to consider to get there? (Video from 2011 & 2012)
- What did people imagine back them?
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ax5cNlutAys
- Algorithms are now about personal choice, delivering information ... what does this mean?
- One Person's opinion: https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles?language=en#t-525329
- What does this mean for education? Remember, Eli Pariser is only asking you to be aware of the information you consume
- Algorithms might be the next way of thinking ... "knowing what we need to do what we need"
- What are the ethics of algorithms?
- What will be your next steps in school? What will be your next things you learn? What choices and items will you learn so the grades and courses you earn and complete will empower you to the next best steps?
