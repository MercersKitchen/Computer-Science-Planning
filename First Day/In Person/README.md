Making a Culture of Creating and Problem Solving, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/First%20Day/In%20Person#making-a-culture-of-creating-and-problem-solving">
More Information</a>
- If you knew how to create it, it would not be a problem ... and you have multiple guides
- Computer and Online Materials
- Teacher: answering questions, presenting some materials, scheduling time through time consuming projects

Final Exit Slip: "What do you want to accomplish this semester?"
- Tell Mr. Mercer so I can see if it can be worked into the course
- Ensure this is in your Project Portfolio on GitHub
- Always space for you to work on your own project using lessons learned in the course

Clubs and Teams: Which Club or Team are you interested in (see Mr. Mercer for more details)
- Club Day is ...

Icebreaker Game: Pin the Tail on the "Geek"
- Geeks are all different shapes and sizes, usually interested in something, doesn't have to be technology
- Answer on a Sticky Note, or paper: I am geekie about ...
- Answer on another Sticky Note, or paper: I want to be geekie about ...
- Fold each piece of paper up so the writing cannot be seen
- Put it in the basket
- Later, when you have two pieces of paper, look around the room and given one piece of paper to one person who does not already have a piece of paper
  - Preferably someone who does not know you or you know that person
- Purpose: even if the person had a piece of paper, answer to yourself why you believe or feel they fit the description
- Purpose: answer to yourself, is this piece of paper correct, does the person who gave me this paper know me
- Purpose: what is my first impression of people
- Reflection as large group: giver of piece of paper share reason paper was given (issue of first impressions) to verify if first impression was true
  - CAUTION: acceptable "giving reason" can because there was no one else or other non-first-impression-reasons
- Reflection: are first impressions valid; brainstorm main societal uses of first impressions

## Problem-solving of a beginning workstation

Setting up a workstation: Laptop, Monitors, OS Settings & Configuration, Mouse, & Keyboard
- Cooperating with others to set up seating plan
  - Sit close to others who will help you learn (and balance your distractions)
  - Movement problem of figuring out work flow in the classroom: Issue of tripping hazards
- Benefit: no student ever has equipment that does not work without knowing what to fix
- Mention issue of sticky hands on laptop keyboards and trackpads vs. spring-action keyboards and USB-mice
- See YouTube Video, an old classroom space but still appropriate: https://youtu.be/Bw1hj3s-8S0

Setting up Multiple Monitors: see Display Settings (Right-click on desktop)

Movies when Hardware Problems take over the classroom lesson
- Machine Learning, Living in the Age of AI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJixNvx9BAc
- Do you trust this computer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVprGRt39yg

## Making a Culture of Creating and Problem Solving
Creating a Community, Thoughts from a Video ... **UNESCO Style**
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=tyaEQEmt5ls
- "Video is about what we can change and what we cannot change." We need to know the difference.
- Summary of DNA Journey
   - DNA cannot be changed
   - Beliefs, who I like, who I do not like, can all change
   - "Who is your cousin?"
   - "It will be in a community ideas are nurtured and people supported"

Teaching answers or teaching with questions, Mr. Mercer prefers teaching with questions and problem-based learning
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1K2jdjLhbo
- An example algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=il5oEPNASmg
- Is this true?
- A video of the full algorithm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMjnDdrujSU
