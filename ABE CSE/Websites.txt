Theory, Concepts
- (CSS1) Explore architecture of Internet
  Client-server relationships of Real (MAC) and Logical Addressing
    - workstations
    - stub networks
    - LANs defined by switch
    - WANs defined by router (edge router)
    - MANs defined by region or provider
    - Backbone of Internet defined by "in the wild" routers
  TCP/IP & OSI Models: IP Socket is main goal
    - SSH & Putty
    - TightVNC, Real VNC
    - Note: review main ports, public & static, public and variable, variable

    - DNS
    - Pathways
    - Browser
    - EMail Server

  Accumulation
  Determining maximum or minimum values
- (CSS3) Paper and Pencil Fail Test (Case Study or Real Website) with "pre" and
  "post" conditions, program control mechanisms, and data processing
- (***) Introduce CSS Variables and algorithmic structure for styling websites

Data and Data Structures
- (CCS2) HTML Forms & Data Flowchart Analysis

  Variables and Constants
  Assignment, arithmetical, relational, Boolean, concatenation, and string
    construction operators
- (CCS3) Arrays and Rest Operator
- (***) Introduce CSS Variables and other structures for advanced styling effects

Coding (Algorithm Translation)
- (CCS1) Use Markup Languages

  determine and outline the intent of the document
  organize the document into appropriate subsections or pages
  describe the content to be carried on each page
  illustrate how the content is to be displayed
  identify the locations of the required anchors and links
- (CCS1) Document Design to hypertext using tags, attributes, and hyperlinks
  mark off the various parts of the document
  display text and visual data in a variety of formats
  create specialized formats such as lists, tables and frames
  create both textual and image-based hyperlinks (single images & mapped images)
- (CCS1) Use style codes inline with HTML
- (CCS1) Enrichment: java-script writing HTML
- (CCS2) Use CSS to add style to HTML
  Embedded
  Separate Files
- (CCS2) Use HTML Forms
