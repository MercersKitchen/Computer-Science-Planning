Theory, Concepts
- (CP1) Computer Science vs. Computer Engineering (future vs. present)
- (CP1) Software development: iterative and incremental
- (CP1) Software Development: waterfall
- (CP1) Tools for Systems Development Life Cycle Model
  Data Flowcharts
  Pseudocode
  Input-Output-Processing
- (CP1) Control Structures
  Sequential
  Decision
  Iterative
- (CP1) Data Representation
  Binary
  Hexadecimal
  Standard or Primitive
  Data Storage models (address, value | shelf, item)
- (CP1) Architecture of Von Neumann Machine
  Block Diagram of flow
  Typical devices associated with each part
  Flow of Data
- (SP1) Introduction to development environments
  IDE: editor, interpreter & syntax, command line or console, execution

Algorithm
- (CP1) Essential
  Accumulation (running total)
  Determining a Mean (central tendency, not median, or mode without sorting)
  Maximums and Minimums
- (SP1) Use IPO structure, maintain separations
  Structure maintained through Procedural and Object Methodologies
- (SP1) Record Output in Appropriate format
- (SP2) Use More than one IPO Module
- (SP2) User Input Data (sensor) vs. Computed Data vs. Hard-coded data
- Enrichment: using libraries to simplify coding using prebuilt functions

Data and Data Structures
- (SP1) Primitive Data Types and Boundaries of these
  Integers
  Real Numbers: floats & doubles
  Characters
  Strings
- (SP1) Variables and Constants (for Security)
- (SP1) Literals
- (SP1) Input Command (methods or operators)
- (SP2) Use Boolean data for decision and iterative control structures
  Boundaries of Data, including internal markers for outputs or errors
- (Enrichment) Introduce Arrays
  Alpha-numeric numbering
  Grouping variables and constants
  Using Index to match boundaries of data expectations
    (See Music Player Project)

Coding (Algorithm Translation)
- (SP1) Use documentation and Syntax
  Internal: comments
  External: ReadMe.txt, ReadMe.md
- (SP1) Interpret and Change
  Syntax Errors: recognize and change
  Logic Errors: in various places like debugger or console
  Run-time Errors: in console or Rendering errors
- (SP2) Use following literals or operators
  Assignment
  Arithmetic
  Relational
  Boolean
  Concatenation
  Interpolation
- (SP2) Use Appropriate selection or iteration structures to avoid unconditional
  branching or exiting
  I.e. Nested conditional (IF-IF | AND)
  I.e. Nested Iterative (similar to 2D Array, 2D Plane)
