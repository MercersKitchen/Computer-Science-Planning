## School-level Courses, Project-based (see other repositories)
- Projects create structure of outcomes
- Referenced Curriculum
- Vocabulary and Concepts
- CAUTION: because of project-based learning and some students spending a lot 
  more time coding than others, leveling capacity of students into grades or
  levels is problematic
