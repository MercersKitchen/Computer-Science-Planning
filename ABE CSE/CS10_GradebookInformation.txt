Project Listings and Expectations Summary

Music Player
1. Music Player Case Study
  - Image – GUI
  - Descriptions of Functions
2. Music Player GUI
  - Image of Buttons, 2D Shapes
  - Relationship to Functions, Behaviors
3. General Setup, Library Functions: using Sound or Minim (or other sound player)
4. Basic GUI and Function – based on all classroom work to date
  - 2D Shapes
  - Text
  - Images
  - Quit Button
  - Other Buttons
  - Play and Stop 1 song (array not necessary here)
5. Player Functions – using combination of classroom work and example sound & music players coded by Mr. Mercer
  - Note: array necessary hypertext- Loading Multiple Songs
  - Multiple Songs available to be played (additional sound effects for specific buttons are a bonus)
  - Next Button: will work and will not go past the “last song”
  - Previous Button: will work and will not go past the “first song”
  - Handling Errors for playing “next: and “previous” songs
  - For Example: Array Index Out of Bounds
6 Advanced GUI Elements – student choice to go “beyond” general expectations so the music player has individual
  - Emphasizes research of chosen Library functions- Time: what part of the song as played, total the song has to play
  - Volume: changing the volume
  - Song Title: printing the title of the song, dealing with a song title that is too long for the space provided
  - Other items Mr. Mercer has not recorded or prompted
