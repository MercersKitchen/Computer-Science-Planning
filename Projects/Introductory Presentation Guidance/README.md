# Introductory Presentation for Computer Science Principles

Introduction to Computer Science Presentations
- Fill in the Blanks on this Document OR
- Answer all questions in PowerPoint (or other program) with Words or Images
- **Even Better**: code a program for your presentation (i.e. HTML5)
- [X] File (and Printed Version) contain checklist

Purpose: create the content for the presentation
- Computer Science and Algorithms are a tool for Problem Solving

[] Name of Computer Program:

[] Language Written In:

[] Device deployed to:

Purpose of Computer Program (Problem being solved, issue being studied, or "something" trying to create)
- Answer one of the following questions to address Software Development Cycle (Paragraph Form)
  - Note: Software Development Cycle = IDEA, DESIGN, IMPLEMENT, TEST
  - [] Will you solve a problem with your program?
  - [] Will you learn something new (something you could not do before, personal interest in the program as a tool)?
  - [] Will you create something with your program?
  - [] Will you replicate behavior with your program?
  - [] Will you generate a tool for others to use with your program?

- [] Does this program address societal, cultural, or economic concerns? (Circle One)

- [] Describe possible storage, privacy, and security concerns with this program? (Describe One)

What abstractions are you using? (Answer Each of the following questions in bullet form)

- [] What are you representing in real life, nature?

- [] How is code representing the abstraction?
  - Examples of Abstraction:
    - Parameters of a function (variables might be better, explain why)
    - Procedures (use a single algorithm instead of repeating code)
    - Collections, Lists, and Arrays, then & Copying data to use elsewhere
    - API: Application Program Interfaces OR Advanced Program Interfaces
    - Instead of Repeating Code, use a single algorithm

- Data Needed, Data Planning
  - [] Types of data needed?
  - [] Storage, Reading, Writing?
  - [] Processing, Transforming & Data Memories?

- [] How does the language deal with different levels of abstractions?
  - Examples
    - Processing: use of TABS and Other Files for procedures, methods, classes
    - Processing OOP: use of a driver (void setup & void draw)
    - Pure Java: use of void-main-string-args

- [] Write a commented-only program using Generic Pseudocode to demonstrate programming methodology and program flow
  - Examples
    - Structured Programming: Sequential, Functions, Decisions, Iterations, and simple program structure
    - Procedural Programming: Structured and unique functions, procedures or methods that execute code with and without returning a value
    - Object Orientated Programming: Procedural and Driver Program with Class-structure

How the code functions (mapping IPO, include all data structures even if primitive): answer using paper and pencil in a diagram or flowchart of entire algorithm
- Hint: code first, then writing algorithm in diagram or flowchart with IPO and data structures

- Where do you start? (Answer the following)
  - [] How does program start and end?
  - [] List all the variables and possible mutations
  - [] Name key decisions and in what order.
  - [] Name the inputs (mouse, keyboard, voice, variable types, etc.)
  - [] Name the outputs
  - [] List the order of inputs or outputs (even if they can happen anytime)
  - [] Name other "triggers"
  - [] Identify behaviors or processes that are being repeated
    - Needed for procedures, methods, or classes
    - Identify any outputs here too

- [] Summarize sequence of functions, try explaining why some functions need to be executed before others

- [] Summarize math included (formulae, starting point of variables, boundaries)
  - Includes Booleans, Inequalities (from Booleans or numbers)

- [] Summarize any selections, even if end-user executed

- [] Summarize any iterations, even if end-user executed

- Examples of above
  - Math: random numbers, inequalities & equality, formulae, reasoning
  - Logic: sequencing, selection, iteration
  - Order & sequencing of functions or lines of code (sometimes language specific)
  - Decisions or conditionals: if-then-else, cases, try-catch
  - Iterations or loops: FOR or WHILE
  - Algorithms: Ratios for GUI, Counters, Timer

- Questions Graders will use for algorithm evaluation
  - What does each algorithm called by your algorithm do alone?
  - What do the algorithms called by you algorithm do together
  - How does your algorithm connect to the purpose of your program
  - What mathematical concepts does your algorithm use
  - Where does your algorithm use logical concepts

Features of End-user Experience that connect to the program's Purpose
- Summarized by Case Study, uses clean design
  - [] List all features
  - [] List possible effects when end-user interacts with program (benefits or harms)

- [] Explain intended purpose of each feature (note: end-user can take it to next step)
  - Note: these explanations might take a while but will drastically improve your presentation

[] Adding Comments to Program Code, "make it read like a book"
- Use AP Java DOC expectations

[] Reflection & Solution Stories (Difficulties or Opportunities)
- Revision stories illustrating solutions
- Incremental changes: large scale algorithmic changes (must have algorithm to start with)
- Iterative changes: smaller changes related to functions, parameters (here, debugging is a tool)
- Questions to Focus on
  - When "it" happened
  - How the solution helped you meet the purpose of your program
  - How the difficulty was resolved
  - How the opportunity led to program improvement
  - Whether "it" was independent or collaborative

Summary of Presentation: forms the ending of your presentation
- [] Answers how this purpose affected me, personally
- [] Answers how this purpose inspired me to learn more about CS
- [] Answers how this purpose relates to my dream job
- [] Answers how this purpose will affect my spare time

# Appendix that helps with Above Sections

## Flow Chart Symbols and Related Exam Questions
- Oval: start or end of program
  Include Language Specific Lines of Code (buttons, exit, quit, etc.)
- Parallelogram: input or output of data, text
- Rectangle: key logical steps, has one input and one output
- Rhombus: key decision, one or more inputs, one Boolean Output (true-false)
- Arrow: shows relationships between other shapes
  Represents flow of information and/or logical path of code
  Shows iterations (FOR or WHILE Loops, decision at beginning or end)
- Best to use paper and pencil for this
  Take images, add reasons why, etc.
  ?Use a snipping tools to help with writing responses in digital portfolio?
  Also create case studies
