An Example Method for planning an Introductory Computer Science Project
- Overview of the Problem Situation
   - [] Title
   - [] Brief Description (5 lines in font ariel, size 11, is 65%)
   - [] Communication about exemplars (research your project is starting with)
   - [] URLs of Research, date accessed
   - [] Screen Shots of ideas or thoughts (Images saved in Google Drive and Accessed through URL in ReadMe.md
   - [] Images & Text you are starting with (especially in a website project)
- [] Summarizing a Problem in a Question Statement
- [] Answering your Question with Computational Literacy and Thinking

An Example Checklist (Including Formatting Items for GitHub Markdown)
- [] Item
- [x] Completed Item
- [] <del> Item is deleted but not erased <del>

"Start in one place and develop the other spaces. Even if you have a feeling or
an image, start in that place and add words to the other spaces."

CAUTION: most people think in words and that is the last item
- If you think in words (you will know), then start make notes about
   1. Your Problem
   2. Your Solution
   3. What this might look like on a computer
- Other people who think in feelings or images need to add words
- These are prompts and are at the beginning of the list

General Ideas
- [] Title, Author-Developer, and other Splash Page Details
- [] Design main screen first, then additional screens
- [] Backgrounds and colours (including random colours)
- [] Text and Formatted size
- [] Sounds and or music
- [] Use of buttons, mouse & keyboard, and the Quit Button
- [] Use of time in the game
- [] Use of time in debugging
- [] GUI Design and use of rectangles
- [] 2D Shapes inside game

Specific Ideas: "what does the program do"
- [] Descriptions of what this project does
- [] Actions & Behaviours
- [] Interactions

Experience Ideas
- [] Case Study: Splash Page, Main Screen, Additional Screens
- [] Case Study: draw what a user experiences when ...
     - For example: seeing the Splash Page and ...
       - Note: can feel with Ketai Library and Android by activating vibration motor when the screen changes
     - For example: seeing the Splash Page and ...

Pseudo-code
- [] Describe in detail (see above) what a user will experience
- [] Include past lessons and projects, especially ideas (no code)
- [] Include any code snip-its you remember
