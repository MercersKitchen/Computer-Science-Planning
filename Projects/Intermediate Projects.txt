Design Thinking: Empathizing, Defining, Ideating, Prototyping, Testing
Computational Thinking: ask and answer questions to solve problems with patterns and counting
Developing systems that make choices based on assumptions

Assessment: Group Points for marks based on outcome and challenges
- Individual Points illustrated on a website, static (CS10)
- Output grading sheet using JavaScript (self assessment built in intermediate CS)

General Projects review CS10
- Weather App (uses Open Weather Map API)
  GUI Design and Other Features
  Using the time and date call to populate other variables
  Introduction to string manipulation
- Interactive Tic Tac Toe (See Android Tablet), Use a game to test algorithm and code
  Intuitive Instructions: just play it
  State complexity: 19683 becomes 5478 moves
- Planter App (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)
- Integration of each

Understand how systems make decisions
- Weather App: depending on buttons pressed or information delivered, app will "expected" information
  - GUI Necessary Items: Temperature, ICON for Weather, Temperature & Weather in 3 hours, 6 hours & 9 hours (unless sleeping), Buttons for 3 Separate Cities, 3 additional features (developer chosen)
  - Calculate Ratios of Basic GUI
- Tic Tak Toe: three ideas
  - "if I choose this box, I cannot choose it again"
  - "what is my next best choice given what I have picked"
  - "what is my worst choice given what I have picked"
  - GUI Necessary Items (Rect Divs): Playing Surface, Buttons (Start, Quit, Reset), Clickable X&O, Scoreboard, Option to Save Scoreboard and|or game
  - Calculate Ratios of Basic GUI

Optional: Note Pad program between Web and App using File IO

Ideas to Consider in Weather
- Processing Server-Client
  RPi Camera to Cell Phone ("Look out your window")
  Does weather match forecast, uses image recognition

What these lead to

- Sentence, Paragraph, Essay Grader
- Chatbot & other labs
- Use Processing-Java and port to Pure Java

Extra Projects
- Easter Egg project
- Drag pieces or use lines, etc.
- Able to make templates like line art
