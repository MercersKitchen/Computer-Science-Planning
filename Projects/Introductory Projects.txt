Design Thinking: Empathizing, Defining, Ideating, Prototyping, Testing
Computational Thinking: ask and answer questions to solve problems with patterns and counting
Developing systems that make choices based on assumptions

Assessment: Group Points for marks based on outcome and challenges
- Individual Points illustrated on a website, static (CS10)
  Websites includes "Who Am I Portfolio", Portfolio Mentoring, & Interactive Essay
- Output grading sheet using JavaScript (self assessment built in intermediate CS)

Introductory CS teaches
- how to write a program's GUI to any monitor
- how to take sensor data & visual data and automate programs
- how to own your own data

"How to Develop and App"
- Variables: predefined, calculated, sensor populated, API poplulated, file.txt IO
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): communication with device before program executes
  Delivers geometry
- Counting Patterns and Concepts (how does a Math 10C count?)
  - Forwards
  - Backwards
  - Arithmetic
  - Geometric
  - Squares
  - Combinations (slope, polynomials, etc.)
  - Using time from the Operating System or in Processing-Java (milli-seconds from crystal)
- Start and stop counting (boundaries of variables)
  Evaluating type of number with modulus
  Console output to whether code makes it into IF
- Separating the GUI Space intentionally for feedback
  Nested counting (nested FOR Loops)
- Developing a calculator: bartering for a price
  Understanding a profit-loss graph
  Using formulae to guide responses
- Changing Visual Data based on calculations
- Creating a Drawing Program
- Creating a Music Program
- Creating a Final Project

General Introductory Projects
- Visual Data, Hello World
- Visual Data, Clicking Game with timer
- Algorithms to poplulate variables

"How to code a robot": , planter (3 plants)
- incorporate
- racing a line follower in a track (Sandwich)
  analogue to digital to camera
- planter (with website?)
- Goals or Purpose: map environment for possible choices based on hard coded assumptions

"Device into Data Collection Tool"
- UNDER CONSTRUCTION



Ideas to Incorporate

Cell Phone Sensors
Use Tablets
Arduino Car Breadboards
Planter
VR Experience through camera
Race cars
Wireless RPi router to send information

First course
Bread boarded Arduino to learn sensors and code
Build robots quickly and do code

Sensors and computing with code

Not databases or websites, etc.
