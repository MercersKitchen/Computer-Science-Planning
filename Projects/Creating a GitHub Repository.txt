Creating a GitHub Repository

CAUTION: this is different than GitHub Classroom and Exportable Executables
- GitHub Classroom Daily Assignments are for submission and grading
- Processing-Java creates a Project Folder for computers without a JDK

See BYOD and ensure all software is downloaded and working
- GitHub Link

In the Browser - Creating a Personal Repository
Login to GitHub
Create a Repository using the big Green Buttons
- Remember, click Initialize with "ReadMe.md" file
Navigate to the contents of the repository
Open Repository using GitHub Desktop (Option in Big Green Button)

Open Project Folder on Laptop

Open ReadMe.md for Developer Details and other ReadMe File details
- Ideas and reminders here only
- Simple Markdown and HTML will format ideas for consumption
Create an index.html file for Promotional Details
- General Ideas
  - Notice most images and videos are also linked in ReadMe.md
  - This delivery of content is for GitHub-hosted website
  - Promotion, formatting, website building, etc. will be more developed in this
  doc
- Expectations for index.html (must be named index.html for GitHub Hosting)
  - In the project folder, create a Text Doc and rename it index.html
  - Right-click index.html, open with Atom
  - Type html in the document to create a  boilerplate
  - Create additional links for CSS and JavaScript
If working in Processing-Java: immediately create a Processing DOC and save it
- Will Create Processing Folder for DOC (needed by Java Compiler), exactly the
  same name as Processing-Java File name
If working in Atom (or other WYSIWYG):
- immediately create file names with proper extensions

Reopen GitHub Desktop
- Title Changes in Version Control (log notes you can access and review later)
- Update Master (version saved to your hard drive, able to review these changes
		 in the log notes)
- Push to the Cloud

CONGRADULATIONS: you have now created a GitHub Repository and Project Folder
for collaboration

Include all Prototyping Ideas and Collaboration
- See Google for Entrepreneurs
- Need Paper and Pencil Prototyping (done as planning)
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMjozqJS44M&feature=youtu.be
  Rapid Prototyping 1 of 3: Sketching & Paper Prototyping
- Need Developer Prototyping (done during development)
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lusOgox4xMI
  Rapid Prototyping 3 of 3: Native Prototyping
- Optional: Digital Prototyping is beyond the scope of high school

CAUTION: Collaborating using GitHub
- Always ensure Cloud version is most current
- Different developers must work on different files (limits version conflicts)
- Once changes are "pushed", then collaborators can Fetch changes
- FAIL Safe: "Push" only when you are ready and you know the overall program
	     works with your changes

Note: multiple ways to change contents of Repository
- Preferred Summary
  Push or Fetch Button
  Make changes to child folder (pathways in GitHub)
  Make changes to code using appropriate IDEs
  Title and Describe all changes, as a version control summary
  Commit to Master
  Push or Fetch Button
- Preferred Option: Open Repository using GitHub Desktop
  Click Push or Fetch Button
    - If already in GitHub Desktop Parent Folder, needs to be updated
      CAUTION: it will not be fetched automatically
    - If you made any changes, these need to be pushed
    - If there are any changes that are not committed to the master, you must do
      these too
  Chose "Open Repository"
  Any changes in Project folder will be reflected in the cloud
    - Deleting a folder (seen as pathway in GitHub) will delete pathway in cloud
    - Changing program contents will be seen there too
  Make changes to code using appropriate IDEs
    - OS can be made to open specific file types with specific software
    - Can be changed with "Open With"
- Use Browser and click inside Repository
  Then click Pencil Tool
  Able to click "X" to delete file also
- Use combination of above
- CAUTION: ensure cloud is always most recent
- CAUTION: always push or fetch before closing GitHub Desktop
  Version Conflicts will happen if Cloud is not most recent
- Backup Option: download most recent version of Repository ZIP File to hard
  drive
