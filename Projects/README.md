# Projects
Various Types of Projects through Computer Science Courses

**Remember**: solutions will use computation thinking (student does math, computer does arithmetic)

Introduction to Rapid Prototyping (Google for Entrepreneurs : Rapid Prototyping 1 of 3: Sketching & Paper Prototyping): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMjozqJS44M&feature=youtu.be

## Single Iteration: each iteration will communicate ...

- Paper and Pencil Prototyping, <a herf="">Click Here</a>
  - Content: 2D Shapes, Images, Words, Actions
  - GUI: Graphical User Interface (*imaging one screen first*)
- Using GitHub's README.md file structure and Markdown Language to create a *checklist*
  - See https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Markdown-ReadMe-Documentation

### What is My Question?
- Starting with the project theme ...

**Imagine** the biggest, most *important* problem you can think about, right now ....
- "What am I trying to solve?"

**Describe** it to a friend ...
**Write** a few notes about what you described.
*The more detailed the better.*

**Summarize** this problem in a question ... *something you will figure the answer out for* ...
**Especially** a partial answer you can share with others.

### Paper and Pencil Prototyping
- 11 x 17 Paper: rectangle in the middle so images imagined on the inside and words describe these images on the outside
- Ruler is optional
- Colours and crayons are optional (able to do a legend)
- Scissor are optional too
- Paper will be optional, all design can be done electronically

CAUTION: all design stages have design time limits and some design stages are beyond the scope of this course
- More Importantly, you will be introduced to far more prototyping ideas than you can complete in the time I give you in class
- Remember: the purpose of prototyping is to get your ideas out ... making them flow together

# Introduction to Algorithms, Flow Chart Symbols
- Oval: start or end of program
  Include Language Specific Lines of Code (buttons, exit, quit, etc.)
- Parallelogram: input or output of data, text
- Rectangle: key logical steps, has one input and one output
- Rhombus: key decision, one or more inputs, one Boolean Output (true-false)
- Arrow: shows relationships between other shapes
  Represents flow of information and/or logical path of code
  Shows iterations (FOR or WHILE Loops, decision at beginning or end)
- Best to use paper and pencil for this
  Take images, add reasons why, etc.
  ?Use a snipping tools to help with writing responses in digital portfolio?
  Also create case studies
- Online Tools
  Raptor (raptor.martincarlisle.com)
  Online Flowchart Maker (draw.io): share via GitHub, Drive, etc.
  MindMeister (mindmeister.com)
  Padlet (padlet.com)
