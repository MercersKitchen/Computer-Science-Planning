# Projects
Various Types of Projects through Computer Science Courses

**Remember**: solutions will use computation thinking (math but the computer does it)
- This course helps you understand math class so math class might get easier

### Materials for the final version, record as you program your software
- 11 x 17 Paper: rectangle in the middle so images imagined on the inside and words describe these images on the outside
- Ruler is optional
- Colours and crayons are optional (able to do a legend)
- Scissor are optional too
- Paper will be optional, all design can be done electronically

CAUTION: all design stages have design time limits and some design stages are beyond the scope of this course
- More Importantly, you will be introduced to far more prototpying ideas than you can complete in the time I give you in class
- Remember: the purpose of prototyping is to get your ideas out ... making them flow together

### Beginning Activity - sometimes as a thinking experiment
**Imagine** the biggest, most *important* problem you can think about, right now ....
- "What am I trying to solve?"

**Describe** it to a friend ...
**Write** a few notes about what you described.
*The more detailed the better.*


**Summarize** this problem in a question ... *something you will figure the answer out for* ...
**Especially** a partial answer you can share with others.
