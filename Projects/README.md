### Beginning Activity - sometimes as a thinking experiment
**Imagine** the biggest, most *important* problem you can think about, right now ....
- "What am I trying to solve?"

**Describe** it to a friend ...
**Write** a few notes about what you described.
*The more detailed the better.*


**Summarize** this problem in a question ... *something you will figure the answer out for* ...
**Especially** a partial answer you can share with others.
