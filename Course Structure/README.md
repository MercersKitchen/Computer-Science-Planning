  - Introduce Minim Library and effects ( ```.loop()``` )
  - Introduce developer declared functions: "ease of reading and review in IDE"
- [] (60%) Measles - Practice Assignment with teaching
  - How ```draw()``` interacts with ```setup()```
- [] (50%) Images, Text, Shapes: various ways ot write code
  - What are the beginning algorithms
  - How are variables manipulated, then used
  - What is the list of algorithms
    - Display checking & algorithms: size will not run, 80% max, ```fullscreen()``` will run on any display, android
    - resizable screen is bonus - research needed

NOTE: reminder about how assignments are graded and how final course grades are marked
