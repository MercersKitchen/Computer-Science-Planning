Notes:
- order is based primarily on indicated prerequisites and supporting courses
  (secondarily on intended content)
- Often intended content overlaps or is repeated and since projects form
  beginning, not discrete courses as units, assessment fits curriculum
- Practicum courses and other work experience courses require fit into main
  courses

Caution: Websites, Robotic Programming, and Second Language need to fit within 
Main Courses Order
