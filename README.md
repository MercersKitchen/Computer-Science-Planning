# Computer Science Planning
Intended for Teachers: Text Documents and Supporting Documents to begin imagining classroom experiences and projects-based learning

**Purpose**: jurisdictional & curriculum-level documents intended for project-based learning
- See Folder ABE Curriculum
  - CSE: intended for Computer Science Courses
    - Note: Website Outcomes overlap with previous "Communication Technologies" Curriculum Documents for Writing Websites
  - ELT: intended for "Physical Computing" (the coding side of robotics and physical interactions)
    - "Where the physical can make concrete the lines of code in a robotic app"
- Curriculum Level Documents called Courses in Computer Science Education of Alberta Education's Career and Technology Studies
- Curriculum Documents also from College Board's Advanced Placement: Computer Science Principles & Computer Pathways
  - See Folder AP CSA CSP

**Organization of Outcomes**: to facilitate industry-level, project-based learning
- See Folder ABE CSE
- "Thinking Like a Professional Developer": for example: web developer, production software developer for apps, etc.
  - Note: Develop Linked In Account for Part Time Jobs and Summer Internships
- Sections: Theory & Concepts, Algorithm, Data & Data Structures, and Coding (Algorithm Translation)
