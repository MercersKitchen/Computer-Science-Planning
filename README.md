# Computer Science Planning
Intended for Teachers: Text Documents and Supporting Documents to begin imagining classroom experiences and projects-based learning

Ideas:
- Python through Coursea
- Netacad: Python, C++
- Course Video Sets: Python, JavaScript, React Native (See below)


**Purpose**: jurisdictional & curriculum-level documents intended for project-based learning
- Curriculum Level Documents called Courses in Computer Science Education of Alberta Education's Career and Technology Studies
- Curriculum Documents also from College Board's Advanced Placement:
    - Computer Science Principles
    - Computer Pathways

**Organization of Outcomes**: to facilitate industry-level project-based learning
- "Thinking Like a Professional Developer": for example: web developer, production software developer for apps, etc.
- Sections: Theory & Concepts, Algorithm, Data & Data Structures, and Coding (Algorithm Translation)
- Presumes an Order of Courses; and, which courses to include
- Illustrates vocabulary, concepts, etc.
- Guides vertical teaming of different courses
- Note: review information given first, then level-appropriate information

Note: Python is available through Cisco Academy at https://www.netacad.com/group/resources/programming-python/1.0
- It is vendor neutral

Note: Supporting School-level Course
- Project-based, entrepreneurial model in flipped classroom environment
- Intended to meet student-learner needs and time-table issues ("two classes at same time")

Note: due to project-based learning and some students coding than others, leveling capacity of students into discrete grades or levels is problematic. Please email Mr. Mercer for more information.

What to expect in school-level courses & project-based beginnings:
- Projects and Assessment necessitate re-structuring of outcomes to fit project
- Projects are ordered to encourage flow of CS Capacity
- Referenced Curriculum
- Vocabulary, Concepts, and other information shared
- Due to project-based learning and some students spending more time coding than others, leveling capacity of students into grades or levels is problematic. Please see Mr. Mercer for more details.

Reminder: Processing-JAVA syntax error
- Sometimes Processing-JAVA's debugger will describe a syntax error that is not true
- Solution:
  - Open new processing-java program
  - copy code to Notepad.txt (deletes all hidden formatting tags)
  - copy from Notepad.txt to new Processing.pde file (including creating any TABs
- Test new Processing.pde file to ensure formatting tags are *not* copied over

Interesting Problem that applies to visual data
- not overlapping rectangles, see partial solution below
```java
int obsticles = 2;
int[] x = new int[obsticles];
int[] y = new int[obsticles];
int[] rectWidth = new int[obsticles];
int[] rectHeight = new int[obsticles];

void setup() {
  size (500, 500);
  for (int i=0; i<=obsticles-1; i++) {
    // Choose Coordinates of first rectangle, parameters of rect()
    int a = i;
    x[i] = int (random (0, 501) );
    y[i] = int (random (0, 501) );
    rectWidth[i] = int (random (x[i], width-x[i]-1) );
    rectHeight[i] = int (random (y[i], height-y[i]-1) );
    if (i>0) { //test for overlap of next values
      //Bigger or Smaller than entire rectangle
      for (int j=a; j<=0; j--) {
        if (x[i] > x[i-1]+rectWidth[i-1]) { //Empty IF
        } else if (x[i] < x[i-1]) { //Empty IF
        } else {
          x[i] = int (random (0, x[i-1]-1) );
          while (x[i]+rectWidth[i] > x[i-1]) {
            rectWidth[i] = int (random (0, x[i-1]-1) );
          }
        }
        if (y[i] > y[i-1]+rectHeight[i-1]) { //Empty IF
        } else if (y[i] < y[i-1]) { //Empty IF
        } else {
          y[i] = int (random (0, y[i-1]-1) );
          while (y[i]+rectHeight[i] > y[i-1]) {
            rectHeight[i] = int (random (0, y[i-1]-1) );
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  //println (x, y, rectWidth, rectHeight);
}

void draw() {
  for (int i=0; i<=obsticles-1; i++) {
    rect (x[i], y[i], rectWidth[i], rectHeight[i]);
  }
}
