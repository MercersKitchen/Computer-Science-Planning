## Campus EPSB, Computer Science (Edmonton Public Schools "Career Pathways")
<a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Bibliography">Click Here for a Course Specific Resource List</a>

In this group of courses, with a special application procedure, students earn industry-level certification through Cisco Academy. Desktops, laptops, Cisco Switches, and Cisco's Packet Tracer allows students to gain hand skills, conceptualization, and knowledge. IT Essentials, CCNA Parts 1 and 2, and Cyber Security forms the core of this experience. Enrichment includes Internet of Things and language specific opportunities with Python and C++, ending again with industry-level certification.

## Advanced Placement, Computer Science 30 (Two Streams Below)

This course is split into two streams. Students who complete CS20 are able to use this course to prepare for the Computer Science Principals digital portfolio and final exam. Students who complete CS30 are able to use this course to prepare for Computer Science Principles and Computer Science A Final Exam. Both streams have post-secondary acceptance. This means, in many cases, their work in High School will count for credit in first year computing courses.

### Advanced placement Computer Science A Stream
<a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Bibliography">Click Here for a Course Specific Resource List</a>

In this stream, students continue to develop Advanced Placement Labs in Processing-Java and Pure-Java to prepare for their final exam. This final exam is a paper and pencil exam testing their Pure-Java knowledge and understanding. This course ends with a presentation to Post-secondary and Industry Leaders about a program and topic of their choice, called "CS Pitches".

### Advanced placement Computer Science Principles Stream
<a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Bibliography">Click Here for a Course Specific Resource List</a>

In this stream, students develop a program of their choice and reflect on various Computer Science Concepts. All work is submitted to the College Board's Advanced Placement Grading Group through a Digital Portfolio. Students end the course with two requirements. The first is a Final Exam broadly covering various aspects of computer literacy. The second is a presentation to Post-secondary and Industry Leaders about a program and topic of their choice, often connected to their digital portfolio, called "CS Pitches".

## Computer Science 30
<a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Bibliography">Click Here for a Course Specific Resource List</a>

This course continues from Computer Science 20. Students continue with GitHub (version control software) organizing websites and computer applications. Instruction reviews Processing-Java from Procedural Programming to Object Orientated Programming in Pure-Java and controlling visual data with Processing-Java functions and Pure-Java Objects. Then, students move to controlling text and sorting data using Pure-Java and the Java Compiler directly through Command Line. These skills lay the foundation for post-secondary Computer Science and the Advanced Placement Computer Science A Exam (students are able to register for Advanced Placement Computer Science 30). Enrichment includes using databases based through Google Sheets API for JavaScript, or PHP, or SQL, and using a WAMP Server to execute this code locally or through a Raspberry Pi Server. After this course, students are well prepared for the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principals Digital Portfolio and Final Exam; and the Computer Science A Exam, both offered during Advanced Placement Computer Science 30.

## Computer Science 20
<a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Bibliography">Click Here for a Course Specific Resource List</a>

This course continues from Computer Science 10 as students use GitHub (version control software) organizing websites and computer applications. Instruction focuses on websites using HTML5 and computer applications using Java integrated with API's (Advanced Programming Interface) and JSON File Input-Output. Projects include a Business-style Website introducing students to Skills Website Competition and writing a Weather App using weather sensors accessed through an API Key (able to run on a computer or side-loaded to an Android device). At the end of Computer Science 20, students are prepared to register for AP Computer Science 30, preparing for the AP Computer Pathways Digital Portfolio and Final Exam.

## Computer Science 10
<a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Bibliography#computer-science-10-introductory">Click Here for a Course Specific Resource List</a>

In this course students learn computer literacy, computational thinking, and applied coding. Instruction and projects focus on building webpages and focused applications able to run on computers. Enrichment includes webpage markup with Cascading Style Sheets, using web-hosting services or progressive web apps, and side-loading to Android Devices. Projects include continuing their Digital Citizenship with a Webpage Portfolio (USESCO-style) and creating a fully functional music player using YouTube's Audio Library, other royalty-free content, or purchased content. Ethics, communication, and various field trips further broaden students understand of how computer science fits into career pathways.

## Computer Pathways
<a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Computer-Science-Planning/tree/master/Bibliography">Click Here for a Course Specific Resource List</a>

This course starts with Project-based learning: "students learn exactly what they want to learn". Using an entrepreneurial experience, students develop deliverables within a timeline scheduling grading sessions with the teacher. Opportunities exist with computer science (Java, Python, C++, and Scratch), robotics (Sphero and Ozobot), Internet of Things, and Networking (Cisco Academy). More importantly, students are able to apply their project to mentor younger students at neighboring elementary and junior high schools. Their *Final Exam* is a presentation (part of "CS Pitches") to Post-secondary and Industry Leaders.
